# Value of research proposals

This is an R Shiny App which allows easy and quick value of information calculations to estimate the value of research proposals.

See https://www.york.ac.uk/che/research/teehta/research-prioritisation/ for further details.

To run the shiny app from R you must have the shiny package installed and run the following command from the R console: shiny::runGitHub('OpenVOIdemo.v.0.1', 'david-glynn')

Alternatively a running example will be available at a forthcoming web address.
