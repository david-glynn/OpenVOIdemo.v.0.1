# Value of research proposals

This is an R Shiny App which allows easy and quick value of information calculations to estimate the value of research proposals.

The approach translates the uncertainty in the primary outcome into health consequences. If a decision is uncertain there is a chance that the optimal treatment will not be chosen. The value of research is the value of avoiding sub optimal decisions. Full details of the approach used and applied examples using these methods are forthcoming. In the meantime see https://www.york.ac.uk/che/research/teehta/research-prioritisation/ for further details.

To run the shiny app from R you must have the shiny package installed and run the following command from the R console: shiny::runGitHub('OpenVOIdemo.v.0.1', 'david-glynn')

Alternatively a running example will be available at a forthcoming web address.
